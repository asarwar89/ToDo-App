# Considerations
* Tested on latest browser only. May not be compitable with old browsers.

* Tasks are ordered by active and complete. Then by priority high to low.

* Few demo tasks are added to help with testing purposes

* As theres no backend/database, the app does not store the state. Hence, on refresh app loses all tasks and starts fresh with demo tasks.
